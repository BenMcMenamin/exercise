              For this project, I used an Agile methodology to complete it. The plan and design of my project is easy to understand. In the first round, the microbit displays one letter, either A or B, if the user gets this correct, the sequence of letters increases by one. The game continues until the user gets a sequence wrong. If the user gets a sequence wrong, the game ends immediately. The score is calculated through the number of sequences the user gets correct. The number of button presses in each correct sequence is sent to firebase for data for the graphs, eg. 6 correct sequences = 21 clicks.  All of the code for the game was designed using microbit make code and Thonny was used to send the data to firebase and to create the graphs. The graphs were created through an extension of Thonny called Matplotlib, which is an easy to use graph maker. The game starts when the user presses both A and B at the same time. When the game begins it displays one of either A or B and displays a question mark afterwards to let the user know that they can make their guess at that stage. If the user presses their answer before the question mark appears, the game ends and their score is not taken into account. If the user gets the answer correct, a tick appears before moving onto the next round. If the user gets the answer wrong, the microbit displays an x before the game ends. When the game ends, the words “game over” are displayed along with the users score from that game. For an easier understanding of this code, please take a look at the flowcharts below. Flowcharts are an easy way to understand any code. I have created a flowchart for both my microbit and Thonny code. I have also created an architecture diagram to show what websites I have used to complete this project. As stated in the investigation, the project also calculates the users moving average, this helps me meet a basic requirement as if the last calculated moving average is higher than the second last, it sends a message to the user letting them know that their memory is improving. If the second last calculated moving average is higher than the last, it sends a message letting the user know that their memory is decreasing and that they should get some rest to improve their well being. As stated above, please see the flowcharts and Architecture diagram below:

WEEK 1:
The first thing I did when starting this project was immediately trying to think of an idea that would meet the brief. I found it quite difficult to think of a project that would help your well being. My idea came while I was a home feeling bored and I started playing a memory game on my laptop. Once I realised that this is what I wanted to do, I got to work on my code.

WEEK 2: 
It took me a while to come up the idea so I didn't start on the microbit code until week 2. I scoured the internet for the type of game I wanted and I found a website with a similar game to what I wanted. I knew I had to change a bit so I didn't just copy it from internet. I added a lot more functions, like score counter, sounds etc. This week was very productive as I finally made a proper start on my project

WEEK 3:
Week 3, I finally completed all of my microbit code and the game was working brilliant. However, that was just the easy bit as it was all going to get more difficult from here

WEEK 4:
Week 4, I started coding on Thonny to try and send data from my microbit to Thonny and then from Thonny to Firebase. I got my data successfully going from my microbit to Thonny but was having issues getting it to go from Thonny to Firebase. Looks like I'll have to wait till week 5 to finish that part

WEEK 5:
Week 5, I finally got my Thonny data to go to Firebase within the first day, meaning I could spend the rest of the week working on my graphs. The bar chart was quite simple to make but it was the line graph that posed the challenge. Trying to calculate the moving average was very difficult to the stage where I could not finish it in this week

WEEK 6:
Week 6, I completed calculating the moving average and created a line graph to display that data.
