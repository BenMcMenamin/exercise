            When it came to starting my project, I immediately was drawn to the idea of a memory game. Memory games are a great way to help your wellbeing as it provides a fun way to test your memory. I began researching immediately, looking for any game that looked interesting and that I would know how to go about coding. I found my idea through a on a website while searching, see website in reference section. I plan to focus on improving people’s memory and decreasing their boredom, both of these are a great way to help and improve people’s wellbeing. My target audience will mainly be people who are suffering from boredom and want to experience a challenge. There is no limit on age as all ages experience these feelings. These points make it so that I can carry out both the basic requirements and the advanced requirements. The game is completely user based as each user is asked to type in their name before playing and their score will be stored into a database and put into a both a bar chart and a line graph. The bar chart is pretty simple with the x axis being how many times the user has played the game and the y axis being the score each time they’ve played. There is also a line that goes through the middle of the bar chart, that line indicates the users average score. If one of the users score from a game is below their overall average, the graph shows it as blue. If one of the users score is above their overall average, the graph shows it as red. In the rare case where one of the users score is the same as the overall average, the graph shows it as purple. The line graph is slightly more advanced as it displays the moving average for a user in groups of three, for example, if the users scores are (1, 3, 6, 10. 15) the moving average starts with finding the mean of 1, 3 and 6, then moves onto 3, 6 and 10 and finally 6, 10 and 15. The user will then be presented with each of these averages (3.33, 6.33, 10.33). A line graph will then be produced with a plot on each of these averages and a line going through them. For an easier understanding on how the graphs work, please take a look at the examples below:
